## Gilded Rose test

#### Design approach: 

I have decided to create 5 Item sub-classes, one for each product type. Each class would extend the parent class and inherit its properties. Having separate sub-classes would allow me to set specific behaviours for the updateQuality method.

#### How to install and run code and tests:

Test can be run by opening the SpecRunner.html file in the browser. The code can be run in the console in the same browser window (as all required filed are linked into the SpecRunner file). 

#### Example from Console:

![alt test](lib/console)
